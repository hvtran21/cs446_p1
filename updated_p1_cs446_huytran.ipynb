You can implement these rules in any way that makes sense to you as long as you honor the result of the rules as presented below, including dependencies between the rules. They are described on the assumption that you apply them as a sequence of steps in the order listed, though, and encourage you to do that rather than be clever.\n","\n","*Hint: some of the steps generate new sequences that, in turn, need to be tokenized. You will probably want to think about a way to use recursion to handle that.*\n","\n","1. Start with **ONE** space-separated token as in the <em>spaces </em>tokenizer above. (In reality, you'll do this for all of them. For simplicity we consider one at a time.)\n","\n","1. A token that is a URL of the form \"https://&hellip;\" or \"http://&hellip;\" should be recognized as a single token. If there is trailing punctuation, it is not part of the URL and that punctuation should be discarded. Note that \"https://hithere.com+https://howdy.org\" should be considered as one simple token (since it starts with https). Also note that \"446https://hithere.com\" is _not_ a URL because it does not start with the URL signal. Make sure to handle the cases of \"HTTP\" and \"HTTPS\" (etc.) as the start of a url is case-insensitive. No other changes to a URL token should happen &ndash; i.e., for a URL, ignore the remaining rules below.\n","\n","3. Convert the tokens to lowercase.\n","  \n","4. Treat numbers as a single token, including plus and/or minus signs, commas, and decimal points if they exist, so that \"3,141.59\" remains that string. A number can only be a sequence of numeric characters and those punctuation marks indicated <span class=\"\" style=\"color: #98ca3e;\">but it must have at least one number character. You do not have to validate that the number is well formed (so \"3+14..1,59\" and \"-1-5\" would both still be number tokens). Do no other processing to number tokens.\n","\n","5. Apostrophes should be \"squeezed out\" so that it is as if they were never there. That means that a contraction such as \"don't\" would turn into \"dont\" and a name like \"O'Brian\" will become \"obrian\" (because it is was also lowercased in step 3).\n","\n","6. Any remaining punctuation <u>other than periods and hyphens</u> should be treated as a word separator (as if it were white space: note the sequence of whitespace rules from the spaces tokenizer), except recall that punctuation in a URL (step 2) or number (step 4) is not a word break. So one token can generate multiple tokens: \"3/11//23\" will result in [\"3\", \"11\", \"23\"], and \"3^rd\" will result in [\"3\", \"rd\"], but \"3.14/pi\" will result in [\"3.14\", \"pi\"]. If a new token is a number (as defined above), do not process it further. So in the example, \"3.14\" will not be treated as an abbreviation by step 8. You may prefer to do this recursively to handle these rules on sub-parts. So that \"b.c.,\" (note the comma) would result in \"b.c.\" (remember that periods are not word breaks) and an empty token. A recursive call on \"b.c.\" will result in \"bc\" from abbreviation rule 8 and the empty token will be discarded.\n","\n","7. Hyphens (not treated as word separators) within a token should be processed in three steps: (1) remove the original token with its hyphen(s), (2) add new tokens with the hyphens treated as space separators (as in the spaces tokenizer), and then (3) add a new token with all hyphens squeezed out. So,\n","\n","  [\"data-base\"] &rarr; [\"data\", \"base\", \"database\"]<br/>\n","  [\"mother-in-law\"] &rarr; [\"mother\", \"in\", \"law\", \"motherinlaw\"]<br/>\n","  [\"a.-b.-c.\"] &rarr; [\"a.\", \"b.\", \"c.\", \"a.b.c.\"]\n","\n","  Note that as with the punctuation rule, the hyphen processing will result in additional tokens. Apply all tokenization rules to each of the tokens that are generated. So \"1.-on-1.\" will generate [\"1.\", \"on\", \"1.\", \"1.on.1.\"]. The occurrences of \"1.\" will remain unchanged because they are numbers, but \"1.on.1.\" will be treated as an abbreviation and converted into \"1on1\". There are some edge cases that will cause odd things to happen (e.g., the token \"1-https://Some.Url\" will end up converting the embedded URL to lowercase which contractadicts rule 2), but we won't stress about unusual subtokens caused by hyphens; we'll just accept and respect them for being what they are.\n","\n","8. Treat abbreviations as a single token. If a token is not a number or URL and the only punctuation it contains is periods, it is an abbreviation. Note that this includes a token that comprises nothing but periods, even if that is not intuitive. For an abbreviation, remove all periods. So \"i.b.m.\" converts to \"ibm\" and \"Ph.D.\" and \"Ph.D\" both go to \"phd\" (because an abbreviation does not need to end with a period and because rule 3 converted it to lowercase). If the result of removing the periods is an empty string, then treat it as an empty token and do not report it out."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DjVPROnPTEPY"},"source":["Here are some sample tokenizations that should happen:\n","* Token &rarr; token (lower case rule)\n","* She's &rarr; shes (apostrophe rule and lower case rule)\n","* Mother's-IN-Law &rarr; mothers, in, law, mothersinlaw (apostrophe, lowercase, hyphens)\n","* U.mass &rarr; umass (lowercase, abbreviation)\n","* go!!!!team &rarr; go team (non-period punctuation rule)\n","* USD\\$10.30 &rarr; usd 10.30 (non-period punctuation, case, number)\n","* USD\\$10,30 &rarr; usd 10 30 (not period punctuation, case)\n","* USD\\$10-30 &rarr; usd 10-30 (not-period punctuation, number (not hyphen!!))\n","\n","There will be interactions between rules, and that is OK.

Misc & Grading\n","\n","\n","**SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS**. P1 will be graded in two assignments within Gradescope. To start, be sure that your name and ID number and the URL for your notebook are listed at the top of your copy of the notebook.\n","\n","1. The first, called P1, is the autograded part that will exercise your code, running a number of tests on the data you already have and then some tests on held-out data that you do not have access to. Go to gradescope and upload your notebook there.\n","\n","1. The second,  called P1-analysis, is just for the various analysis questions. First make sure that your notebook has run all of the cells and that the output -- the open response questions toward the end and the graphs -- are visible. Then generate a PDF version of your notebook and upload the PDF to P1-analysis. (We'll post a reminder about how to generate the PDF to Piazza; you did it for X1 in case that helps remind you.) In this case, align your notebook to the analysis questions that are provided. Be sure that you include all of the pages that contain a particular question's answer and only pages that contain that particular question's answer.\n","\n","Probably you'll repeat the first part until you're happy with it and then upload the second part when that's all done.\n","\n","Your grade will be split into two parts, one from P1 and one from P1-analysis. They should add to 100 or 110 if you do the extra credit (and get full marks).\n","\n","\n","When you submit your code, the autograder will run:\n","\n","* up to 18 possible combinations of the command line on the training input (3 tokenizers, 2 stemmers + not stemming, stopping or not)\n","\n","* at least spaces-noStop-noStem and fancy-yesStop-porterStem on _Pride and Prejudice_\n","\n","* at least fancy-yesStop-porterStem on a held-out evaluation set that you do not have\n","\n","You may find a utility such as <em>diff</em> (Linux) helpful to compare your output to the expected output on <em>P1-train</em>, though it will require that write the output to a file. For the others, you'll have to eyeball it to see if it looks right. Or you may want to write a quick comparison function for your own use.\n","\n","Some things that you might want to consider while coding and debugging:\n","\n","* If you start with the <em>spaces</em> tokenizer and turn off stopping and stemming, you can check that this foundation step (breaking the text into space-separated tokens) works by a fairly simple examination. That happens to be the same as the spaces-noStop-noStem sample output for P1-train.\n","\n","* Running the output of spaces tokenization through the stopping and stemming algorithms isn't likely to be very helpful for you (though we will grade it!) because the leftover punctuation reduces the number of times stemming occurs.\n","\n","* You can compare spaces-noStop-noStem to fancy-noStop-noStem to see if your fancier tokenizer is working. You can look to see that numbers and URLs pass through unchanged, the hyphens and other punctuation behave as described, and so on.\n","\n","* Then shift to fancy-yesStop-noStem to see if stopping is working\n","\n","* And then fancy-yesStop-yesStem for see if the whole process works\n","\n","* For this project, it does not matter if your code prints debugging information. It will be ignored by the autograder. The exceptions are around the analysis questions: try to keep those free of \"clutter.\""]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.7"},"orig_nbformat":4},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
